# Ryan's KScripts

Being an Android developer, I've grown to love Kotlin. With holgerbrandl's [KScript library](https://github.com/holgerbrandl/kscript), we can now use Kotlin for general scripting.

This part of my dotfiles is for simple KScript applications I've created to help my development. I organize applications like a standard Java or Kotlin project, each being modularized with shared utils accessible by any other application.

## Application

Each script is directly executable, which can be run locally through `kscript
