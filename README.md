# Ryan's dotfiles

Just making this since I'm sick of syncing my profiles everytime I switch computers.

Heavily inspired by https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles.

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rbro112/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && source setup.sh
```

To update, cd into the dotfiles directory and then:

```bash
source setup.sh
```

To update without a confirmation prompt:

```bash
set -- -f; source bootstrap.sh
```
